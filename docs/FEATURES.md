## Core Features

### Multi-Channel Control

Control multiple independent LED channels simultaneously.

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ **6+ channels** on Arduino Uno
- ✅ **10+ channels** on Arduino Due/Mega
- ✅ **Independent timing** for each channel
- ✅ **Parallel execution** - all channels run simultaneously
- ✅ **Individual start times** - channels can start at different times

**Example:**
```
CH1: ON at 21:00, blinks for 30min
CH2: ON at 21:30, solid for 1hr
CH3: ON at 22:00, pulse pattern
```

---

### Automatic Calibration

Compensates for Arduino clock drift for precise timing.

**How It Works:**
1. Python sends test commands with known durations
2. Arduino executes and reports actual elapsed time
3. Program calculates calibration factor
4. All subsequent timings are corrected

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Accurate timing** over long periods
- ✅ **One-time calibration** - factor saved for reuse
- ✅ **Automatic correction** - applied to all commands
- ✅ **Temperature compensation** - accounts for crystal drift

**Calibration Factor Example:**
```
Calibration Factor: 1.00131
Means: Arduino runs 0.131% slower than expected
All times multiplied by this factor
```

---

### Pattern Compression

Automatically detects and optimizes repeated sequences.

**Example:**
```
Original: ON 5s, OFF 5s (repeat 100 times) = 100 commands
Compressed: PATTERN with REPEATS=100 = 1 command
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Memory efficient** - reduces Arduino memory usage
- ✅ **Faster upload** - fewer commands to send
- ✅ **Cleaner output** - easier to read command files

---

### Flexible Timing

Support for multiple time units across input formats.

**Supported Units:**
- **Seconds**: `s`, `sec`, `second`, `seconds` (all synonyms work!)
- **Minutes**: `m`, `min`, `minute`, `minutes` (all synonyms work!)
- **Hours**: `h`, `hr`, `hour`, `hours` (all synonyms work!)
- **Milliseconds**: `ms`, `msec`, `millisecond`, `milliseconds` (all synonyms work!)

💡 All time unit synonyms are automatically recognized - use whichever you prefer!

**Float Support:**
```
2.5 seconds = 2500ms
1.5 minutes = 90000ms
0.5 hours = 1800000ms
```

---

### Start Time Scheduling

Three flexible ways to schedule when channels start.

**1. Time-Only Format**
```
'21:00' or '21:00:30'
→ Today at 9:00 PM (or 9:00:30 PM)
```

**2. Full Datetime Format**
```
'2025-11-08 21:00:00'
→ November 8, 2025 at 9:00 PM
```

**3. Countdown Mode**
```
120 or 30.5
→ Start in 120 seconds (or 30.5 seconds)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Daily schedules: Use time-only
- Specific events: Use full datetime
- Quick testing: Use countdown

---

### Serial Communication

Robust protocol for Arduino communication.

**Features:**
- ✅ **Handshake protocol** - "Hello" → "Salve" verification
- ✅ **Error detection** - timeouts and retries
- ✅ **Multiple board types** - Uno, Due, Mega
- ✅ **Automatic port detection** - finds Arduino automatically
- ✅ **Baud rate: 9600** - reliable across all boards

---

## Advanced Features

### Pulse Frequency Control

Control LED behavior during ON states with precise pulsing.

**Capabilities:**
- **Frequency Range**: 0.01 Hz to 100 Hz
- **Pulse Width**: 1ms to period duration
- **Duty Cycle**: 0-100%
- **Memory Efficient**: Only ~960 bytes for 6 channels

**Use Cases:**
- **Breathing effect**: 0.5 Hz, 200ms pulse
- **Warning flash**: 2 Hz, 100ms pulse
- **Slow blink**: 1 Hz, 50ms pulse
- **Strobe**: 10 Hz, 10ms pulse

**4 Parameter Combinations:**

1. **Frequency + Pulse Width**
   ```
   frequency=1.0, pulse_width=100
   → 1 pulse/second, 100ms ON
   ```

2. **Frequency + Duty Cycle**
   ```
   frequency=2.0, duty_cycle=10%
   → 2 pulses/second, 10% duty cycle
   ```

3. **Period + Pulse Width**
   ```
   period=1000, pulse_width=200
   → 1000ms period, 200ms ON
   ```

4. **Period + Duty Cycle**
   ```
   period=500, duty_cycle=20
   → 500ms period, 20% ON time
   ```

---

### Wait Status Control

Define LED state during countdown before protocol starts.

**Options:**
- `wait_status=1`: LED ON during countdown
- `wait_status=0`: LED OFF during countdown

**With Pulse Support:**
```python
WAIT_PULSE: {
    'CH1': {'frequency': 0.5, 'pulse_width': 100}
}
# Channel 1 breathes slowly during wait
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Indicator**: ON during wait shows system is ready
- **Dark mode**: OFF during wait for nighttime setups
- **Breathing**: Pulse during wait for visual feedback

|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| start_time  | 21:00 | 21:00 | 21:15 |
| wait_status | 1     | 0     | 1     |
```

**Column-Based Format** (Best for 5+ channels):
```
| Channels | Start_time | Wait_status |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| CH1      | 21:00      | 1           |
| CH2      | 21:00      | 0           |
| CH3      | 21:15      | 1           |
| CH4      | 21:15      | 0           |
| ...      | ...        | ...         |
```

|--------|------------|---------|
| Frequency | Pulse Width | `f=1.0, pw=100` |
| Frequency | Duty Cycle | `f=2.0, dc=10%` |
| Period | Pulse Width | `T=1000, pw=200` |
| Period | Duty Cycle | `T=500, dc=20` |

**Automatic Conversion:**
- Program normalizes all formats internally
- Choose the most convenient format for your use case
- Mix formats between channels

---

### Descriptive Comments

**Easier to:**
- Add/remove channels
- Read channel configurations
- Manage 10+ channels

**Still supports:**
- Original row-based format
- Auto-detection of format
- Both formats in different files

---

### Flexible Column Naming (Synonym Support)

**November 2025 Enhancement**

Multiple naming conventions automatically recognized:

**What it does:**
- Use short forms, full names, or alternatives
- All synonyms work identically
- Choose naming that makes sense to you

**Supported Synonyms:**

**Time Units:**
```
Seconds:      _s, _sec, _second, _seconds
Minutes:      _m, _min, _minute, _minutes  
Hours:        _h, _hr, _hour, _hours
Milliseconds: _ms, _msec, _millisecond, _milliseconds
```

**Pulse Parameters:**
```
Period:       period, T (capital!), cycle_time, cycletime
Pulse Width:  pulse_width, PW, pw, on_time, ontime
Duty Cycle:   duty_cycle, DC, dc, duty
Frequency:    frequency, freq, f, hz, Hz
```

**Examples (all equivalent):**
```excel
# Time columns
CH1_time_s       = CH1_time_sec      = CH1_time_seconds

# Frequency columns  
CH1_frequency    = CH1_freq          = CH1_f

# Pulse width columns
CH1_pulse_width  = CH1_PW            = CH1_on_time

# Period columns
CH1_period       = CH1_T             = CH1_cycle_time

# Duty cycle columns
CH1_duty_cycle   = CH1_DC            = CH1_duty
```

**Use Case:**
- Import existing protocols without renaming columns
- Use domain-specific terminology
- Shorter column names for compact sheets
- Clearer names for documentation

💡 **Tip**: Stick to one style per file for consistency!
